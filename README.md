Honolulu, Here I come! Congratulations! 
You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area.

First, I decided to analyze the last 12 months of data. August, did I say to my boss? Not a great period to go to Hawaii. Precipitations are possible and more relevant compared to other months, also the Std in 2016 tells me that there is a lot of variability in the weather. Maybe, I'll bring an umbrella with me. 
Unfortunately, I have good data for August 2016, not a lot for 2017 to compare.
